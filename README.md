## About BeierWish

BeierWish is a project I created to re-create the functionality of AddWish to create and share editable wish lists.

The initial goal is to get a website and an Android app running with the functionality of creating/editing and sharing wish lists, and the ability to "reserve" wishes on a list, which makes it so other signed-in users can see someone else already bought the gift and avoid duplicate gifts.

To avoid the recipient finding out what they are getting, the reservations can only be seen from a signed in account that doesn't have ownership of the wish list.

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the project.

For now, I would prefer if you first open an issue with your idea and implement it in a fork before creating a pull request.
